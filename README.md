## Features

- BLE composite keyboard/gamepad and native USB keyboard/gamepad HID
- Automatically selects USB when the host connects during startup; otherwise starts BLE after a 2.5-second detection window
- 11 buttons (Select, Start, Launch, A, B, X, Y, Left flipper, Left MagnaSave, Right flipper, Right MagnaSave)
- 4 D-pad input (to navigate in Pinball VR Classic menu)
- 1 dedicated button for mode cycling (FX, Classic, VPX)
- Nudge detection with MPU6050 accelerometer:
    - Classic: analog nudge (acceleration sent on left stick)
    - VPX: analog nudge (velocity sent on right stick)
    - FX: digital nudge (peak detection)
- RGB LED status indicator (when `RGB_BUILTIN` is available)

## Hardware Requirements

### Main Components

- **ESP32-S3** development board (other ESP32 variants with BLE should work as well, provided they have enough GPIO pins)
- **MPU6050** 6-axis accelerometer/gyroscope module (I²C interface)
- **11 momentary push buttons** (fewer are required if you intend to use only FX or Classic modes)

> [!TIP]
> GoldLeaf Pushbuttons from Ultimarc are great for this purpose.

- **Arcade joystick** for D-pad input (optional, can be replaced with 4 buttons, only required for Classic to navigate menus)
- 1 additional momentary push button for mode cycling (FX, Classic, VPX)
- 5V power supply (I use a 5V power bank)

### Wiring

#### I²C Connection (MPU6050)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the module is installed with the axes rotated, modify the SENSOR_ROTATION constant accordingly in `config.h`

| MPU6050 pin | ESP32 pin | Description          |

#### Button Connections

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Connect one leg of each button to the specified GPIO pin and the other leg to GND.

## Installation with Arduino IDE

### Board

#### ESP32 3.3.7 *by Espressif Systems*

- See https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html#board-manager-settings

### Libraries

- Go to "Tools" -> "Manage Libraries".

#### NimBLE-Arduino 2.4.0 *by h2zero*

- Click "Filter your search" and type "NimBLE-Arduino".
- Select version `2.4.0` and click the "Install" button.

#### MPU6050 library 1.4.4 *by Electronic Cats*

- Click "Filter your search" and type "MPU6050 cats".
- Select version `1.4.4` and click the "Install" button.

### Compilation and Upload

1. Open the project folder in Arduino IDE
2. Select the ESP32 board (e.g. "ESP32-S3 Dev Module")
3. Select the correct serial port (e.g. COM3)
4. Click "Upload"

> [!TIP]
> Or you can use `arduino-cli` and an IDE like CLion (free for personal use).
> `CMakeLists.txt` is provided for this purpose.

## Usage

### Initial Setup

1. Power on the ESP32
2. Wait for the device to complete MPU6050 calibration (keep it stationary)
3. Connect the ESP32-S3's native USB port to a PC with a data-capable USB cable during startup to use USB HID. If no USB host is detected during the startup window, BLE starts automatically; pair with "VR Pinball controller". Reboot to switch transports.

For USB HID, select **Tools -> USB Mode -> USB-OTG (TinyUSB)** in Arduino IDE. The USB cable must be connected to the board's native USB/OTG connector, not a USB-to-serial-only connector. Other ESP32 boards need native USB OTG support to use wired HID.

### Mode Switching

Press the "Change mode" button to cycle between modes:

- FX Mode (keyboard): RGB LED = Blue (like in key[B]oard)
- Classic Mode (gamepad): RGB LED = Green (like in [G]amepad)
- VPX Mode (keyboard): RGB LED = Purple (like in v[P]x)

Mode is saved in EEPROM, so it will be restored on next boot.

## Troubleshooting

### Serial Monitor Output

- Connect at **115200 baud** to see debug information

> [!TIP]
> Use a serial monitor like [Termite](https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm)

### Compilation Errors

- Verify all required libraries are installed
- Check libraries versions

### Device Not Connecting

- Verify that Bluetooth is enabled on your host device (Quest or PC)
- Check that the device "VR Pinball controller" appears in your Bluetooth settings
- Remove the previously paired device and restart Bluetooth on the host
- Restart ESP32 and retry pairing

### MPU6050 Not Detected

- Verify I²C wiring (SDA, SCL, VCC, GND)
- Check the MPU6050 address (default is 0x68, some boards use 0x69)
- Update the MPU6050_ADDR constant if needed

### Nudge Not Working Correctly

- Ensure MPU_INT_PIN wiring is correct
- Check that SENSOR_ROTATION value in `config.h` matches MPU6050 orientation
- Adjust ANALOG_NUDGE_MAX_ACCELERATION (FX) or ANALOG_NUDGE_MAX_VELOCITY (Classic & VPX) in `config.h`

## Change Log
